Larnach Castle Makers Market
Sunday 12 October 9am to 5pm  
145 Camp Road, Dunedin  

We will have a stall showing off and selling beautiful baskets made by us, using willow that we grow, harvest and prepare for weaving, here in Dunedin. Every basket is unique, the sizes, shapes, patterns and colours reflecting both the individual maker and the varieties of basket willow used. Beautiful and robust, a willow basket is a treasure to use and admire for many years to come. We will have a range of basket styles and sizes for sale, as well as smaller woven items and ornaments.
