Periodically throughout the year we run workshops for beginners. These are taught by volunteer basket makers who love to share their knowledge and skills. 

The beginners workshop teaches the basics of weaving a round basket, using willow we have grown ourselves. This workshop will give you a taste for working with willow and some of the different weaving patterns. At the end of the weekend, you will have made a lovely basket and hopefully be inspired to continue working with willow. 

The workshops are held over a weekend, 10am – 4pm Saturday and Sunday. 

Cost: Suggested donation is $200 - $250. We acknowledge that this amount may not be within everyone’s budget, our  aim is to encourage people to learn so please get in touch to discuss options. Please be generous as all the money raised goes to supporting the willow beds and the huge efforts of our group of volunteers who look after, grow, harvest and prepare the willow. 

If you would like to get on the wait list for the current or upcoming basketmaking season, please [contact us]({{ url('/contact') }}). Please be aware we currently have a long wait list for the beginners workshops.
