## Annual Harvest

<x-img src="/assets/img/harvest16July2023.jpg" caption="Beginning the 2023 harvest." class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We harvest the willows annually, in the winter when the plants are dormant. Harvest usually happens late June / early July, after all the willows have dropped their leaves, and before the sap begins to move again. 

**2025 dates for harvest are the first two weekends of July**  
- 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> July  
- 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> July

## Monthly Working Bees
<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20181124_163001906_HDR.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

We have regular working bees through the year to look after our willow beds.  Itâ€™s a great chance to see the yearly cycle of willow growth and learn more about identifying the different species and varieties of willow. Weeding, mulching, and cutting grass are our main working bee activities. Bring along weeding tools, gloves and wear sturdy shoes or gumboots. Also bring a hot drink and a snack for afternoon tea. 

We hold working bees on the first Sunday of the month. Working bees are 11am to 3pm.

The upcoming working bee days are:
 
- Sun 4<sup>th</sup> May
- Sun 1<sup>st</sup> June

## Weaving Get-Togethers

<x-img src="/assets/img/IMG_20211121_152957753.jpg" caption="" class="float-right w-1/3 mx-2 my-2"/>

Through the year we hold making days. We work on various projects, using a variety of materials. Past examples include tension trays, bending frames and handles, making string and brushes. These are co-learning spaces (no dedicated tutors), where the group will try ideas gleaned from the internet or books, and share tips for techniques (often learned while making mistakes!).  

Cost: suggested donation $2 (members) and $15 (non-members), to help cover the cost of hiring the workspace.

For more information and if you wish to join please [contact us]({{ url('/contact') }}). 

The date for the next weaving get-together is:

- TBD but we will have another event soon.
